<h4>My Experience with Justin</h4>
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
<p>I first discovered the young Bieber at the tender age of 10, and I have 
not stopped listening to his music ever since! His songwriting has a quality 
to it that is not found often within the realm of popular music. Below is a 
video of one of his biggest hit songs to date, <i>Sorry</i>!
